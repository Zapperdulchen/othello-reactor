# Othello TicTacToe Reactor

This is a fork of http://timothypratley.github.io/othello/

I used the base to implement the front-end to a reactor game. As a Clojure newbie I learned a lot on:

- Moving a ClojureScript project including devcards from Leiningen to clj
- Understanding a miniscule code base from someone else without knowing the involved frameworks so that I can enhance it
- Doing front-end development 

_old readme:_

## Overview

This project demonstrates extending a basic Tic Tac Toe game.
We created the rules for Othello.
Why not create your own board game?

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
